# Relay-timer-manual
This is a switching process based on timer. In timer we set our required time for off or on for a device. Timer will follow the time and make the device off or on right time. 
This circuit is consists of one twin timer, two single timer relay, three relay contactor, two magnetic contactor, a plug and connecting wire. 
By the twin timer regulator we can set our required time for switching, two single timers are conected to the twin timer parallely and working as a counter according to twin timer set time, two magnetic contactors are connected with the two single timer relay as a switching device, they are performing switching operation by the single timers relay's power supply. A plug is connected for power supply.        
Video is too big for upload, so there is some photo of my project.
